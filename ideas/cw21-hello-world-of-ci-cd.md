_This document should be used to capture the information for a Hack Day Idea._


### **Idea name (provisional)**

_This is the provisional name of the Idea, solution or just a title; this can be changed later if a team is formed and you decide on a new team/product name._

**Hello World! (of CI/CD)**


### **Context / Research Domain**

_Please describe the context or research domain to which the problem applies_

Software engineering


### **Problem**

_Description of the problem you are trying to solve_

Build a Hello World app (but make it support continuous deployment.)

This hack day idea is more about developing skills, and less about the idea itself. 

I want to gain experience using best practices like TDD and CI/CD, but I never seem to get around to actually doing it. I also want to explore different ways of collaborating on a group leaning/coding exercise, so this is also about experimenting with that.


### **Solution**

_Explanation of the solution to the problem you have identified_

I like the idea of doing this as a ‘mob programming’ exercise with a small group of other developers, the idea being that we can learn from and motivate each other. Maybe the end result can be packaged as an activity and/or group learning format for others to use and benefit from, but it isn’t a requirement.

Some tutorials that might serve as starting point:

I think a cookbook of CI/CD recipes would be a great potential output!
