_This document should be used to capture the information for a Hack Day Idea._


### **Idea name (provisional)**

Inclusive authorship/contributor tool 



*   Name ideas = Credit Me or All authors - 
*   **Credit All**


### **Context and/or research domain**

Relevant to all domains to attribute contributions to research projects from all contributors more fairly in the authorship of academic publications.  


### **Problem**

Current systems that attribute contributions to authors in academic outputs do not include all of the jobs/roles/tasks that are encompassed in research projects. 

Issues include:



*   Capturing all roles on a project.
*   How to capture all tasks within those roles.
*   How to give different weight/credit to tasks completed or should they all have equal value?
*   How to convert this into the actual authorship - will it be a to z, random, ranked or a consortium?


### **Solution**



*   Expand current lists to be more inclusive - using current systems such as CRediT, INRIA, BIDS Contributors.
*   Develop a tool to be used to record these contributions during the project such as within a Github repository. 
*   Develop a way that this can be shown on academic papers - lists, table, cinema title page? (look at e.g. Brainhack paper w 100+ authors and Living with machines).


### **Diagrams / illustrations**
