# Exploring previous Collaborations Workshop ideas (CW-ideas)
This is the repo for a hack day project from the [2021 Collaborations Workshop](http://www.software.ac.uk/cw21) which aims to explore ideas from previous Collaborations Workshops and provide them in an easily browseable and searchable form.

A live version of the website is hosted at [https://softwaresaved.github.io/CW-ideas/](https://softwaresaved.github.io/CW-ideas/).

The repo consists of markdown versions of the collaborative ideas and hackday pitches, plus code to host a website to view them.

To contribute to the repository - either by adding new ideas from previous CWs, or to contribute to the code to view the ideas - please see [the contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).

This repository is licensed under the MIT license, and all the ideas themselves are CC-BY (this is mentioned at the bottom of each idea).

The team creating this was Mario Antonioletti, Heather Turner and Robin Wilson.

## Building locally
The repository is automatically built and deployed on every push, but if you want to build locally for testing or debugging purposes, follow the instructions below:
1. Install [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/)
2. In the root of the repo, run `hugo server`
3. The site will be built, and served on localhost - see the command-line output for the full URL
