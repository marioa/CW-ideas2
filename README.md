# Exploring previous Collaborations Workshop ideas (CW-ideas)
This is the repo for a hack day project from [Collaborations Workshop 2021](http://www.software.ac.uk/cw21) which aims to explore previous ideas from Collaborations Workshops and provide them in an easily browseable and searchable form.

A live version of the website is hosted at [https://robintw.github.io/CW-ideas/](https://robintw.github.io/CW-ideas/).

The repo consists of markdown versions of the collaborative ideas and hackday pitches, plus code to host a website to view them.

To contribute to the repository - either by adding new ideas from previous CWs, or to contribute to the code to view the ideas - please see [the contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).

This repository is licensed under the MIT license, and all the ideas themselves are CC-BY (this is mentioned at the bottom of each idea).

The team creating this was Mario Antonioletti, Heather Turner and Robin Wilson.
