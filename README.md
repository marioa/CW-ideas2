# Exploring previous Collaborations Workshop ideas (CW-ideas)
This is the repo for a hack day project from [Collaborations Workshop 2021](http://www.software.ac.uk/cw21) which aims to explore previous ideas from Collaborations Workshops and provide them in an easily browseable and searchable form.

The repo consists of markdown versions of the collaborative ideas and hackday pitches, plus code to host a website to view them.

To contribute to the repository - either by adding new ideas from previous CWs, or to contribute to the code to view the ideas - please see [the contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).
