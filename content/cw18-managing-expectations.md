### **Context / Research Domain**

This problem is often found within Research Software Engineering like-teams working collaboratively in a number of research projects. 


### **Problem**

_Now that the necessity of having an RSE in a project is established, the issue of managing the expectations of the projects and allocating resources to multiple concurrent projects._

How to manage expectations while juggling different projects with overlapping deadlines and competing resources? 

* _Difficulty in saying ‘no’_
* _Difficulty of knowing when to say ‘no’ and fallout (no metrics for what happens if you say ‘no’, only if you say ‘yes’ and fail to deliver)_
* _Difficulty in estimating how long a project is going to take_
* _Issues of software sustainability - how is the software going to be maintained? Maintenance even on best effort basis is not easy to get into; not dealing with service maintenance_
* _Differences between disciplines - collaborative, team-based disciplines (e.g. physical and life sciences) vs humanities; vision of RSEs as support rather than collaborators_
* _Issue of co-location_
* _The value of a project manager_
    * _Recognised management of people and time_
* _We are competing with post-docs_
* _Constraints: time, resources_
* _People leaving - easier to manage in big projects where there were several people involved_


### **Solution**

_Explanation of the solution to the problem you have identified_

The first step is setting the expectations at the right level with the researchers. 

* _Discuss with the researchers what is the MVP and how this impacts research. Then add prioritized features on top of this (until the time/money runs out). **This works really well **_
    * _Provide something quickly and then iterating_
    * _MVP produced in third of the time for the project_
* _Time-focused expectations_
    * _Buying/selling time rather than buying/selling a finished product_
    * _If they want the product, they don’t have the money_
* _Frequent and constant communication_
* _Project management tools (even if no tool gives the perfect solution)_
    * _Features required: report projects, team members, time and skills_
    * _Harvest and Forecast ([https://www.getharvest.com/forecast](https://www.getharvest.com/forecast))- for the team_
    * _Tools for personal projects: Trello, Waffle, Github project management tool (Project)_
* _Funders need to be made aware and accept that the running costs of a software may well keep on being incurred after the end of the project. Or “flick-of-the-switch” principle: lights go out after three years, if someone has an interest in continued use, they’ll pay you to run it._
* _Senior RSEs managing projects_
* _Managing expectations all the time is not scalable_
    * _What we need is a culture change_
