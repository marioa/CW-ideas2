#### **Context and/or research domain**

_Software sustainability._

**Problem**

_We have been conducting monthly ‘[Collaboration Campfires](https://contributor.r-project.org/events/collaboration-campfires)’ that are informal sessions to discuss and learn how to contribute to the R project. These campfires are a part of the Digital Infrastructure Incubator by the Code for Science & Society. For facilitating and supporting these campfires we plan the sessions on etherpad which includes activities that help newcomers to become familiar with the tools that the R project is based on. This infrastructure has worked well for organizing and running the sessions. Now we would like to turn them into a resource that is more permanent, useful for potential organizers to re-run or for potential contributors to use for self-learning._


#### **Solution**

_To make the Collaboration Campfires material sustainable and available to the future learners, we want to build reusable beginner-friendly lessons for contribution to the R project, using the materials that we have been creating for the campfires and host them on our webpage ([https://contributor.r-project.org/](https://contributor.r-project.org/)). We propose to use the [Carpentries lesson template](https://github.com/carpentries/styles/) as demonstrated by their [example lesson](https://github.com/carpentries/lesson-example). For this hack day, we will convert the material from two Collaboration Campfires: “[Explore R’s Bug-tracking Process](https://developer.r-project.org/etherpad/p/collaboration_campfire_february)” and “[How to Help Review R Bug Reports](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rAerV1_Kw_lX_M4XwqEdIxvakYfREarBsfLmoK0vUEk/edit)” into a single lesson. 

We will be using RStudio to create these lessons (as described in [The Carpentries Workbench](https://carpentries.github.io/sandpaper/) documentation) and GitHub Pages for deployment ([GitHub repo](https://github.com/r-devel/r-bug-tracking-lesson)). We will use the Collaborations Workshop 2022 Slack (#quail), Zoom and GitHub issues for communications._
