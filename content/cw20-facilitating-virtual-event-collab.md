### **Context / Research Domain**

Many collaborative events / workshops are moving online because of the COVID-19 situation; but more generallyâ€“ can we run events like the CW hackday online, and what would it take?


### **Problem**

How do we facilitate effective collaboration in a virtual event, where:

* People have to work across multiple time zones: all conversations/communications need to be documented some way on a channel that everyone in the team (at least) can access and consume easily
* Itâ€™s more difficult, esp for newcomers, to get to know other people
* Thereâ€™s a lack of watercooler/coffee machine conversations
* Version control and tracking changes could be trickier?
* There are different accessibility considerations in comparison to an in-person event, e.g. internet connectivity
* _Anything more?_


### **Solution**

**Approach 1**. Map in-person event collaboration workflows for the various roles (e.g. team lead, documentors, devs, communicators); identify the steps that we have good technical solutions for and the ones that donâ€™t; prototype the ones that donâ€™t

* The assumption of this approach is that in-person collaborations are productive ðŸ˜œ

**Approach 2.** Start with the virtual constraints (imagine that in-person events never existed)â€“ build a few participant personas and map the steps via which they would best collaborate. Do we have tools for every step? If yes â€“ can the integrations be smoother? If not â€“ can we prioritise and build them?

_Open to other approaches as well_

**Means:** For our own collaborative mapping within the team (meta ;)), maybe we can try using [miro](https://miro.com/signup/)? Open to suggestions!

**Deliverables:**

* A list of existing tools that could help collaboration, in a GitHub repo
* Maps with identified technological gaps
* Some prototypes and wireframes for someone to take it from here and build on it! (if we have time, we can try building some too)

**Skills:**

* Product management and UXâ€“ Help guide the story mapping and keep us focussed; help prototype
* Community managementâ€“ Provide a deep understanding of communication/engagement pain points across a diverse community of participants
* Research â€“ Landscape and making sure weâ€™re not reinventing wheels
* Anyone passionate about making the best out of the current situation
