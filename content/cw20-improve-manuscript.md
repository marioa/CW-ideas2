### **Hackday Idea Proposer**

**Philipp Boersch-Supan (@pboesu)**


### **Context / Research Domain**

_Research Software Dissemination / Software Peer Review_


### **Problem**

_This is perhaps a rather mundane issue, and maybe too small a project for a hack day, but it’s an issue with direct relevance to the SSI, so I thought I’d propose it nonetheless:_

**_Let’s make some better manuscript templates for the Journal of Open Research Software_**

_As a reviewer I find the template for software papers provided by JORS irksome. While they are well structured for the purpose of the final product they do not feature pagination or line numbering which makes reviewing cumbersome._

**Solution**

_Update the tex/docx/odt templates to enforce pagination and line numbering._
