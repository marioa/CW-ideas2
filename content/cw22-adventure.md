## **Collaborative Ideas session group: J-Juniper**

#### **Participants**

* Chris Jochem, University of Southampton, w.c.jochem@soton.ac.uk
* Achintya Rao, The Alan Turing Institute, arao@turing.ac.uk

#### **Collaborative Idea Title**

Choose your own research-software adventure

#### **Context / Research Domain**

Social scientists don’t typically code (there are exceptions!) and most that rely on software for their research use proprietary tools they are taught to use at university. While the long-term availability of the software may be “sustainable” because of commercial licences providing support, the individual researcher may not be able to access their own work after leaving the setting that offered them free licences for the tool in question.

#### **Problem**

* Lack of awareness of potential options
* No clear path for learning, and you’re too afraid to start; but different people have different paths
* Lots of tools and resources available, but aren’t necessarily linked up (Carpentries, SSI resources, The Turing Way, free e-books)

#### **Solution**

A choose-your-own adventure game to help you find the appropriate skills, tools and communities to support your journey into using and writing sustainable software.

Choose your “class” of character (based on research methodologies and domains)
