### **Problem**

People don’t want to talk about their mistakes, publish code or submit it for review. Only positive results get published. Common reasons for this are fear that “my code isn’t good enough”, “isn’t complete enough”, “has mistakes in it”. We want to encourage people to share their coding insecurities to help normalise talking about mistakes and knowledge gaps. 


### **Solution**

Get people to “confess” about coding mistakes they’ve made in the past. This could either be in just to another individual or to a group. It might get run internally at a single institution or as part of a conference or workshop (mini workshop for CW22??).

The hack day would work on building a list of instructions on how to run a coding confession. Perhaps making a video or a transcript of an example session. 

Taking some inspiration from the Repro Hack idea we could build a central page (like [https://reprohack.github.io/reprohack-hq/](https://reprohack.github.io/reprohack-hq/) ) of resources for running coding confession.
